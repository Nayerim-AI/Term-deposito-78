# Term-deposito-78
This repository contains my solution for the Data Quest competition, a machine learning competition focused on predicting term deposit subscriptions.


My final submission achieved an official accuracy of 0.788 (78.8%) on the private leaderboard. The core of my approach was a powerful ensemble method that combined the predictive capabilities of a custom-built Neural Network and a Xgboost,Catboost,lightGBM,RandomForest model and neural network with optuna. This strategy effectively leveraged the diverse strengths of both architectures to achieve high accuracy.
